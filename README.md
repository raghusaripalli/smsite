# SmartMirrorSite
This is my undergrad final year project.
This site provides login, register, about and dashboard to control items displayed on smart mirror.
This gets input from the raspberry pi camera which is integrated in smart mirror.
Website is integrated with face recognization which identifies the user and customizes widgets displayed on mirror accordingly.
